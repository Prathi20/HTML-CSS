# Bike Repairs in Dublin Webite 

The homepage code is written in [index.html](https://github.com/Prathi20/HTML-CSS/blob/main/Project-2/index.html) for which the styling is done in [style.css](https://github.com/Prathi20/HTML-CSS/blob/main/Project-2/style.css)

This is the second project using HTML and CSS. I've learnt a plethora of new things and implemented them, such as

- Addition of external icons to website
- Border-box
- Inline vs. Block
- CSS Drop shadows
- Custom Buttons
- Horizontal rule tags
- Animated buttons using Pseudo-classes
- Dropdown menu

Clicking on the logo on the contact-us.html page leads back to the [homepage](https://github.com/Prathi20/HTML-CSS/blob/main/Project-2/contact-s.html)
