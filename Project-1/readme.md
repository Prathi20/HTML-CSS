# Adare Restaurant Homepage

This is the first project I've done using scripting languages aka HTML and CSS.

The Webpage contains a simple layout of a restaurant website where they can make reservations, find menu, place orders and book catering services online. 

It also helps locating the restaurant through a live map view.

I've also added a random review video of a restaurant (not Adare lol) that can be useful for people anticipating for a taste of the delicious items available here.

This is full on Beginner Project that I took up as a way to learn HTML and CSS
