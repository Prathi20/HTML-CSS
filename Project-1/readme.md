# Adare Restaurant Homepage

This is the first project I've done using scripting languages aka HTML and CSS.

The Webpage contains a simple layout of a restaurant website where they can make reservations, find menu, place orders and book catering services online. 

There is a live map view I've added to the page to locate the restaurant easier on the maps

I've also added a random review video of a restaurant (not Adare lol) that can be useful for people anticipating for a taste of the delicious items available here.

This is full on Beginner Project that I took up as a way to learn HTML and CSS

P.S: No restaurant named Adare exists. Its made up for the sake of the Project
